## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions Setup

### 1. ‚úÖ Run Tests on PR to `develop`

A workflow runs Cypress component tests when a pull request is created or updated on the `develop` branch.

#### Example workflow: `.github/workflows/test.yml`

```yaml
name: Run Cypress Tests

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ develop ]

jobs:
  cypress-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Cypress component tests
        run: npx cypress run --component
